This app demonstrates authentication using HTTP Basic and friend. To try this example, 
visit <a href="/secure">this link</a> to be prompted for a user and password. You
can login with either friend/clojure or friend-admin/clojure. You should then see
what friend knows about your current user.

<p>
Since most browsers aggressively cache
HTTP Basic credentials, the recommended way to logout is just
close your browser or reopen a private/incognito window.
